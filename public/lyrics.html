        <h3>歌詞</h3>
        <pre>
            Oh-oh
            If you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea
            I'll sail the world to find you
            If you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can't see
            I'll be the light to guide you
            We'll find out what we're made of
            When we are called to help our friends in need
            You can count on me like one, two, three
            I'll be there
            And I know when I need it, I can count on you like four, three, two
            And you'll be there
            'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh, yeah
            Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
            Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah
            If you tossin' and you're turnin' and you just can't fall asleep
            I'll sing a song beside you
            And if you ever forget how much you really mean to me
            Every day I will remind you, oh
            We'll find out what we're made of
            When we are called to help our friends in need
            You can count on me like one, two, three
            I'll be there
            And I know when I need it, I can count on you like four, three, two
            And you'll be there
            'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh, yeah
            Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
            Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah
            You'll always have my shoulder when you cry
            I'll never let go, never say goodbye
            You know
            You can count on me like one, two, three
            I'll be there
            And I know when I need it I can count on you like four, three, two
            And you'll be there
            'Cause that's what friends are supposed to do, oh, yeah
            Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
            Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
            You can count on me 'cause I can count on you
